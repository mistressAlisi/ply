# MAGIC UUIDS are special profiles and items that have special functions in the system.
# They exist in all Ply setups, and they are needed to initialise new profiles and groups. 
# They hold the configuration and templates that are applied to a newly created profile.
# This means that any changes profiles listed underneath will affect profiles created afterwards.
# NAMESPACE: All magic UUIDS use the "special" prefix 0011aa22-bb33.
# PROFILES use the prefix 0011aa22-bb33-0001
# DYNAPAGE PAGE/NODES use the prefix 0044dd55-ee66-0001
